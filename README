Test confirms that with old protocol buffer based serialization/deserialization,
the throughput is 5.2 millions echos/second.

This means our blocking based simple parser is ~2X faster (12.7 million echos/second); 
our non-blocking based simple parser is ~5X faster (24.7 million echos/econd).

Usage:
  $ ./obj/server
  $ ./run.sh

See src/app/client.cc for examples about synchronous and asynchronus rpc clients.
